# Symptom Based Disease Prediction - DWDM Project

## Dataset - Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning

Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kaushil268disease-prediction-using-machine-learning

Total 4932 data objects. Each with 132 attributes that represent binary values to denote presence of symptom.

The labels are 42 different diseases, in nominal form.

## Models Used

-   Support Vector Classifier
-   Guassian Naive Bayes
-   Neural Network with 2 Hidden Dense Layers
-   Decision Tree Classifier
-   Random Forest Ensemble Classifier

**Used for PCA for unsupervised data attribute reduction.**

## Usage

1 . Create a Python virtual environment

```
python3 -m venv venv
```

2. Activate environment

```
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install dependencies from the given requirements.txt fiel

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run python file. _Uncomment code lines to use different models._

```
python main.py
```
